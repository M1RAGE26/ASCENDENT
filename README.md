The document explores the limitations of current GPS navigation systems and proposes AI-driven and AR-integrated solutions to enhance user experience. It begins by highlighting key issues such as the reliance on manual input, delayed traffic updates, distractions while driving, and high battery consumption. The author identifies that conventional GPS apps primarily use voice guidance and static maps, lacking real-time adaptability and hands-free operation, which can make navigation cumbersome, especially for drivers and cyclists. 

To better understand user concerns, a survey was conducted, focusing on challenges faced while using GPS apps, preferences for voice-controlled systems, the potential benefits of AR-based navigation, and personalization options. The findings reveal that users struggle with last-minute instructions, ineffective rerouting, and voice recognition failures in noisy environments. Additionally, many desire more control over navigation settings, such as customized alerts, voice assistants, and flexible route planning options. 

The document then proposes integrating AI for more responsive and intelligent voice commands and enhancing real-time traffic updates. A key innovation suggested is the use of augmented reality (AR) navigation through smart glasses, like Apple Vision Pro, which would project directions directly in the driverâ€™s field of view, improving spatial awareness and eliminating the need to check phone screens. However, challenges such as high costs, visibility issues, and the potential for AR overlays to become distractions are acknowledged. The project concludes by emphasizing the need for improved crowdsourced reporting, better AI-driven traffic predictions, and advanced customization options to make GPS navigation safer, smarter, and more user-friendly. The document also includes a prototype design of the proposed navigation system, illustrating how the app would look and function after implementing the suggested improvements.
